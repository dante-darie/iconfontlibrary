// I need an svg to geometric-library converter
// // values in the y axis need to be inverted
// // geometric-library needs methods for approximating cubic bezier from arc curves
// At this point I should have a map of svg file names containing opentype.js compatible geometric library shapes
// Now I need a mapper between these geometric library shapes and opentype.js commands
// Once I have the opentype commands for each shape, I can generate a glyph for each svg
// Having the glyphs, I can now generate a ttf font / perhaps other formats as well using opentype.js
